Autonomous agent to play https://hackmerlin.io/ (Merlin puzzle game).
This repo will contain a Python Playwright + small-agent pipeline to:
- ask Merlin questions,
- parse Merlin responses for the secret password,
- submit the password and advance levels.

Steps:
1. Setup venv
2. Install deps (playwright, python-dotenv, pydantic, etc.)
3. Run agent in headed mode to debug
4. More steps to be added

See the project plan and instructions in the `docs/` folder (to be added).
